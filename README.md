This is one of the tasks given to us in the internship we are doing with The Sparks Foundation i.e GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program )

# Task1:
Prediction using Supervised ML
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data

# Task-2 :
